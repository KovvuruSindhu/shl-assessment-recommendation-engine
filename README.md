# shl-assessment-recommendation-engine
This project builds an Assessment Recommendation Engine that suggests the most relevant SHL assessments for a given job description. The system analyzes the required skills from the job description and matches them with assessment descriptions using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

The user provides a job description as input, and the engine returns a ranked list of assessments based on relevance. This solution demonstrates text processing, machine learning fundamentals, and recommendation logic and can be easily extended using advanced embeddings, filters, or APIs.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
